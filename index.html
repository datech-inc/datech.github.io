    <h1>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
<p>
    Wemay be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
</p>

    <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
<p>
GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their person data.
</p>
    <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
<ul><p>
Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR vovers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in comboination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, generic data, biometric data, IP address, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Dat Protection Principles include requirements such as:
<li>Personal data collected must be processed in a far, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
<li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfill a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organisations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
<li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose</li>
<li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also requesta copy of trheir data and that their data be updates, developed, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organisation.</li>
</p>
</ul>    

    <h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
<p>
GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greate fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Datech Inc we we strongly bgelieve that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
</p>

    <h1>Individual Data Subject's Right - Data Access, Portability And Deletion</h1>
<p>
    We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. We process or store all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.
</p>

<ul><p>
    The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.<br><br>
